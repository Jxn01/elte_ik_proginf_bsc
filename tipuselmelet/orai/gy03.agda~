The Agda type checker knows about, and has special treatment for, a number of different concepts. The most prominent is natural numbers, which has a special representation as Haskell integers and support for fast arithmetic. The surface syntax of these concepts are not fixed, however, so in order to use the special treatment of natural numbers (say) you define an appropriate data type and then bind that type to the natural number concept using a BUILTIN pragma.

Binding the built-in natural numbers as above has the following effects:

    The use of natural number literals is enabled. By default the type of a natural number literal will be Nat, but it can be overloaded to include other types as well.
    Closed natural numbers are represented as Haskell integers at compile-time.
    The compiler backends compile natural numbers to the appropriate number type in the target language.
    Enabled binding the built-in natural number functions described below.
